Fixed 2 critical issues: 1) JWT authentication (missing dotenv load in auth_service.py), 2) Date serialization for MongoDB (converted date objects to ISO strings). The MyFitnessPal clone backend is fully functional with: ‚úÖ Complete authentication system with JWT, ‚úÖ USDA API integration for food search and details, ‚úÖ Full CRUD operations for diary entries, ‚úÖ Weight tracking functionality, ‚úÖ Custom food creation, ‚úÖ Popular foods aggregation, ‚úÖ Daily nutrition summaries. All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes, handle authentication correctly, and persist data in MongoDB. The backend is production-ready for the frontend integration."
